Spree is an open, community powered project that anyone can contribute to. There are several ways you can help us improve Spree:

* submitting an issue describing a bug or a feature request
* fixing a bug or creating a new feature
* creating a Spree extension
* upgrading old extensions to recent Spree versions
* helping others on Spree slack

## Submitting issues

You can [submit an issue](https://github.com/spree/spree/issues/new/choose) on our [Github Issues tracker](https://github.com/spree/spree/issues)

## Fixing a bug or creating a new feature

Before diving into the Spree codebase we recommend you spend some time to review the [Core internals section](/developer/core/) which will help you understand how Spree works under the hood.

After you're done with that please follow to [Developing Spree guide](/developer/contributing/developing_spree.html)

## Creating a Spree extension

Extensions provide additional features and integrations for your Spree store. You can create your own and share with the rest of the community. Before doing so please check our [Extension directory](/extensions) if your desired extension does not exist already.
